								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p> My interests broadly encompass how animals respond to environments, and if those responses (behavioral and physiological traits) are adaptive. Extreme environments act as natural laboratories for the studies of adpatation, with alpine mountain tops such as the Trans-Himalayas of Ladakh posing some of the most unique and harshest environments to animals that live there. During my PhD, I studied behavioral adaptations of pikas to alpine stressors of cold and seasonal resource abundance in the Changthang Biotic province of Ladakh. </p>
		<p> For my post-doctoral research, I am switching gears and exploring more mechanistic questions with respect to physiological adaptations of animal dormancy. I am studying how  different groups of animals can use periods of dormancy to effectively save energy on thermoregulation (Torpor in Hummingbirds) or bridge unfavourable seasons (Diapause in insects). To address questions at both scales, I use a combination of field experiments, comparative phylogenetics and several Omics appproaches.</p> 
								</p> I have always been fascinated by insects since my childhood and am considering working on them in the future since they have the potential to address large-scale questions given the ease of maintaining laboratory populations and their small genome sizes.</p>

  Digging Deeper: Evolution of Burrowing and Behavioral Traits in Lagomorphs
</h2>
</div>
    
		<p>Lagomorphs—hares, rabbits, and pikas—are closely related, yet show striking diversity in their behavior, sociality, and life history. Some dig their own burrows, some use burrows made by others, while others live in rocky crevices or open nests (Species specific traits). This variation offers a unique window into the evolution of animal behavior and its relationship to ecological pressures.Burrowing is a particularly intriguing trait. It's energetically costly, yet may offer key advantages like thermal regulation and predator avoidance. But how does this behavior connect with other traits like sociality and life history strategies? Are burrowers more social? Do they have different life history traits? And what drives these patterns—climate, body size, or evolutionary history?<p>

<p>To explore these questions, I reconstructed the first comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny of Lagomorpha, using a combination of public exome data and primary whole-genome sequencing to resolve key relationships. This evolutionary tree allowed me to trace the origins and transitions of behavioral traits across the group.

		<p>Figure 1:Well-resolved phylogeny of Lagomorpha (90% nodes with bootstraps > 90) constructed using a combination of exomes and multi-locus markers. Species annotated with stars represent species placed on phylogeny with whole genome sequencing in this study.<p>
	

Key findings include:

<p>a) The common ancestor of modern pikas (Ochotonidae) was likely burrowing, while the ancestor of rabbits and hares (Leporidae) lived in open forms or borrowed burrows.<p>

<p></p>b) Rock-dwelling behavior in some pikas evolved secondarily from burrowing ancestors in the genera Conothoa and Pika.<p></p>

<p></p>c) Contrary to expectations, burrowing was not associated with colder, hotter, or more variable climates (thermoregulatory hypothesis) or with more open landscapes (anti-predation hypothesis).<p></p>

<p></p>d) Life history traits—such as fecundity—did not clearly track with body size or climatic envelopes.<p>

<p>However, a strong pattern emerged: burrowing species tended to be more social and had more r-selected life histories (higher reproductive rates), while rock-dwelling species were more solitary and K-selected. This supports a burrowing–sociality–fecundity link where the energetic costs of burrowing may favor both social living and faster reproduction. Although large-scale data didn't confirm burrowing as a current adaptation to environmental extremes, ongoing field work on pika burrows suggests that they provide significant cooling advantages during summer heat, more so than keeping pikas warm in the winter. Historically, burrowing may have been crucial in helping these animals survive glacial cycles on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, by buffering them against dramatic climate swings. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral evolution is deeply entwined with life history strategies, and that burrows may have played a critical—if complex—role in the ecological success of Lagomorphs.</p>

 Asian pika populations track local glaciation events through the Pleistocene 
</h2>					
		<p>Understanding how species have responded to climate change in the past—especially during the Pleistocene—can offer valuable clues about how they might respond to future climate shifts. Pikas, as cold-adapted, high-elevation specialists, provide an ideal system to explore these dynamics. The elevational shift hypothesis suggests that during warmer interglacial periods, pikas would be pushed up the elevation to track cooler habitats (leading to smaller, isolated populations), while during colder glacial periods, they would expand to lower elevations, rescuing populations from inbreeding.

To test this idea, I combined two complementary approaches:

a) Species distribution modeling (SDM) to reconstruct past habitat suitability across time

b) Population Genomic analyses (PSMC) to infer changes in population size over evolutionary timescales<p>

<p>Focusing on three species—Ochotona ladacensis, Ochotona nubrica, and Ochotona macrotis—from the Changthang Biotic Province on the Tibetan Plateau, SDMs showed that suitable habitats were most extensive during the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ~20,000 years ago) and most restricted during the Last Interglacial ( LIG ~120,000 years ago). Additionally, the most suitable habitats for these species were found at lower elevations during the LGM and at higher elevations during the LIG These findings align with the elevational shift hypothesis: pikas were found at lower elevations during colder periods.<p>

	<img src="images/SDMs.png" alt="Profile Picture" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 0;" />	 
		<p>Figure 1:Habitat suitability maps across different time slices<p>
	
	<p>However, the genomic data paints a different picture of species responses. All three species showed peak population sizes pre-dating both the LGM and LIG, around ~190,000 years ago (MIS-6), followed by steady declines through the LIG and the LGM despite the cold conditions that should have favored population growth. This contrasts our SDM results but can be reconsiled with carefully consideration of local geology and historical glaciation events. The Changthang region, unlike much of the world and other parts of Himalayas, experienced unique paleoclimatic and glacial histories—severe glaciation during MIS-6, a warm interglacial, and surprisingly little glaciation event during the LGM when the rest of the world was rapidly cooling. We hypothesize that pikas are likely to have been at low elevations during the cool MIS-6, driven up the elevation during the warm unfavorable LIG and continued to remain isolated there given the absence of a rescue glaciation event  in this region may have low effective population sizes today as a result of historical inbreeding due to populations becoming isolated on mountain tops in the absence of rescue glaciation events.<p>

<p>Together, this work underscores the need to integrate paleoclimate, local geology, and population genomics when reconstructing species demographic histories. It also emphasizes that species-level models (SDMs) may not always capture responses of populations (PSMCs). A deep understanding of species responses to climate change is necessary for conservation planning and a combination of methods is likely to useful in this regard.<p>

 Sympatric pikas partition microhabitats differently across a spatial-elevational gradient 
</h2>					
		<p>How closely related species with similar ecological requirements co-occur and navigate competition has been a topic of great discussion among community ecologists. Studies have shown that microhabitat partitioning in patchy environments can support the co-existence of sympatric species at small spatial scales.  The project quantified niche spaces and directional niche overlaps of three cold-adapted high-altitude pikas from the Trans-Himalayas that display varying degrees of sympatry along elevational and spatial scales to understand how they respond to inter-species competition. Vegetation and landscape-level features associated with different species across elevational bands were doucmented and key ecological factors that drive the presence of these species was identified. The social, burrowing, Ochotona nubrica was inferred to prefer mature stands and a large cover of shrub vegetation on pastures across elevational bands (2800-4500m). The social, burrowing, Ochotona ladacensis was inferred to be a high-elevation specialist (4200-6000m), occupying both stunted alpine scrub habitats and steppes. The asocial, rock-dwelling, Ochotona macrotis was inferred to prefer microhabitats with good rock cover and large-sized rocks across elevations (2800-6000m), while being associated with significantly greener microhabitats at low elevations in the summer. The visualization of directional niche overlaps across species and populations highlighted interesting scale-dependent patterns of niche segregation between species that are rarely examined. While species may largely be considered genaralists at large spatial scales, they are likely to be specialists at smaller spatial scales. With rapidly changing climate and land-use patterns in the Himalayas negatively impacting cold-adapted mountain specialists, a nuanced understanding of microhabitat associationships displayed by such species in sympatric zones will likely be useful for conservation planning. <p>
